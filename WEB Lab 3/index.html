  Maxime Dufour-Lapointe, who specialized in the moguls discipline like her younger sisters Chloé, 26, and Justine, 24, is leaving the sport after a career that saw her compete in more than 100 FIS World Cup competitions (moguls and dual moguls alike), three World Championships and the 2014 Olympic Games. </p></div>

Kingsbury has a track record like few other winter athletes: his 87 World Cup starts have yielded 48 victories and 70 podiums, contributing to six overall World Cup titles; he also boasts seven world championship medals. But the 25-year-old was without an Olympic title going into PyeongChang 2018.

Sixth in the first final, third in the second and first in the last, Laffont could not have timed her challenge any better.“It’s just crazy,” said the new Olympic champion afterwards.
