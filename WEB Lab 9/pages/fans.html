                <br>The I Munich Madrid Supporters’ Club was set up in 2010 in order to bring all of the Madrid supports in Munich and the surrounding area together. In fact, we are the only supporters’ club in the south of Germany. Since being created until now, the number of members has grown notably. In less than 5 years we have gone from 50 to more than 200 members. Although the majority of fans are Spanish, we have people of other nationalities (Poland, Denmark, Greece…), we therefore form a big Whites family that share a passion for the club.

            Our members and fans are quite active, which results in a magnificent atmosphere for each game that is shown at our headquarters. Also, thanks to the support of Real Madrid in sharing our tickets, we have had the chance to attend lots of games that the Whites have played across all of Europe (Gelserkirchen, Dortmund, Liverpool, Basil, Lisbon…), and we appeared on prestigious Spanish and German media outlets: CUATRO, AS, SER, COPE, RNE, ZDF, SKY, BR… As a result, we are increasingly well-known in the world of Supporters’ Clubs and Real Madrid fans.
