  <h1>History</h1>
  <p>Ski acrobatics have been practiced since the 1930s. Aerial skiing was popularized in the 1950s by Olympic gold medalist Stein Eriksen. Early US competitions were held in the mid-1960s. The International Ski Federation recognized freestyle skiing as a sport in 1979 and brought in new regulations regarding certification of athletes and jump techniques in an effort to curb the dangerous elements of the competitions. The first FIS Freestyle Skiing World Cup was staged in 1980 and the first FIS Freestyle World Ski Championships took place in 1986 in Tignes, France. Freestyle skiing was a demonstration event at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary. Mogul skiing was added as an official medal event at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, and the aerials event was added for the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer. In 2011, the International Olympic Committee approved both halfpipe and slopestyle freeskiing events to be added to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.</p>
  <h1>The Lowdown</h1>
  <p>The freestyle skiing competition is made up of five thrilling disciplines: moguls, halfpipe, ski cross, aerials and ski slopestyle, with each one taking place at the Phoenix Snow Park.</p>
  <p>Bravery, speed and acrobatic endeavour are key in all five events, and each discipline requires the riders to be both technically adept on their skis and competent when executing large jumps. What sets the events apart are the courses on which they’re held. Ski cross is a race set on a track of jumps and wide turns; while ski slopestyle is a judged event on a terrain run of ramps and rails; the halfpipe requires riders to ski along a tube-like slope; moguls is a held on a slope of bumps and jumps; while in aerials, athletes launch themselves from two-to-four-metre jumps to get the biggest air possible.</p>
